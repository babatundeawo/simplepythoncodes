"""
Concepts: Lists, Functions, User Input

Description:
In this project, you'll create a basic command-line to-do list application. Users can interact with the program to manage their tasks by adding new ones, removing completed tasks, or viewing the current list of tasks. The application will run in a loop, allowing continuous interaction until the user decides to quit.

The main concepts you'll practice include list manipulation (adding and removing items), writing and using functions, and capturing user input for various operations. This is an excellent project for understanding the flow of control in a program and the use of functions to modularize code.
