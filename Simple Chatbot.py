"""
We're going to build a simple chatbot that can respond to greetings like "hello," "hi," or "hey." This chatbot will understand these words and give a friendly response back. Let's start by making the chatbot understand what to say when it hears these greetings

        return "Hello! How can I help you today?"

    elif "hey" in greeting.lower():
