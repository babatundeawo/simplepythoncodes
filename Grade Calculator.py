"""
Explanation:
User Input: The program first asks the user to input the number of grades. Then, it collects each grade in a loop.
List Handling: The grades are stored in a list.
Average Calculation: The calculate_average function computes the average of the grades.
CGPA Calculation: The calculate_cgpa function determines the CGPA based on the average grade.
Output: The program outputs the average grade and the corresponding CGPA.
